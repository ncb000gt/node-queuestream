queuestream
========

This is a quick little library I wrote to queue up streams for playback.

For instance, if you want to have multiple listeners on a signle streaming server this will update the stream behind the scenes and send data up to the listeners when data on the new "current" stream exists.

This modules deals with the details of pausing and resuming the streams for you so you should only have to queue things up.


Usage
========

ATM - check the tests and examples. I'll add something later.


Other stuff
========

It's late... I'll fill more of something in later.
